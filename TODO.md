# HTMLReader TODO

- Understand some tests.
  - DOCTYPE token name: empty or nil?
    - Tests seem to think the DOCTYPE token should always have an empty name. I think it could have a nil name.
    - test 2
      - test00
    - test 3
      - test0228, test0231, test0232, test0234, test0235, test0237, test0240, test0241, test0243, test0244, test0246, test0258, and test0656.
  - Entities and parse errors.
    - Tests seem to think these are parse errors, but I don't see it.
      - Entities without semicolons.
        - test 1
          - test28, test35
          - test40, test41, test42
        - entities
          - test01
        - named entities
    - Non-ASCII entities.
      - test 1
        - test 36
    - Empty entities.
      - test 2
        - test20
    - Supposedly invalid characters after &.
      - test 4
        - test08, test10
    - Bogus character references.
      - test 4
        - test11
    - Known entity match with ascii after, in an attribute.
      - entities
        - test 00
- Pass some tests.
  - domjs
    - test12 (extra parse error)
  - unicode chars problematic
    - test2 (parse error between character tokens)
  - Everything mentioned in "understand some tests".
- Fix lossy conversion from html5lib tests to SenTestCase tests.
  - For example, check domjs test3. The leading U+FEFF and middle U+FEFF both disappear. (With NSJSONSerialization the middle one remains, but the leading one still disappears.)
